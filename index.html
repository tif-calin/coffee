        <h2>Ways to make coffee</h2>
        <p>Different temperatures extract different chemicals from the coffee grounds at different speeds. The overall caffeine levels are not that different however.</p>
        <h3>Hot brew</h3>
        <p> 195-205&deg;F is generally considered the best temperature range for making hot coffee. If it gets hotter than 210&deg;F, you may extract more bitter compounds due to certain acids decaying. Temperatures lower than 185&deg;F can lead to a more sour taste as the water's not hot enough to dissolve non-acidic compounds.</p>
        <h4>>> with a French press</h4>
        <p>Coffee grounds are soaked in hot water and then pressed down to the bottom of the coffee maker with a plunger. The metal filters of a French press don't soak up the coffee oils like paper filters from coffee makers do. This leads to a fuller flavor but will also lead to some coffee sediment at the bottom.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Grind some fresh coffee beans until they're about the size/consistency of breadcrumbs. If it's too fine, you'll get murkier coffee.</li>
            <li>Measure it out. For every cup of water you're using, use about 2tbsp of coffee grounds (~13 g).</li>
            <li>Boil the water. Ideally, you'd want it to be 195-204&deg;F which usually translates to letting it just reach boiling (boiling point is 212&deg;F), pulling it off the burner, and then letting it sit for around 45 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add the ground up coffee to the bottom of your press and then pou enough water in to just wet the beans. You can stir it to make sure all of the beans are saturated.</li>
            <li>Wait about 1 minute and then pour in the rest of the water, add the lid, and wait about 3 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Finally, push the plunger down. You want to do this slowly to minimize how many loose grounds end up in your coffee. Now you can pour and serve!</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>>> pour-over coffee</h4>
        <p>A pour-over dripper is placed over a cup and filled with a filter containing coffee grounds. Boiling water is then poured over this filter and the coffee is then dripped directly into the cup. Because fresh water is continuously washing over the grounds, this method promotes a faster and more efficient brew. However, this also tends to extract more from the surface of the grounds </p>
        <h4>>> with a coffee maker</h4>
        <p>Just follow the instructions stupid.</p>
        <h3>Cold brew</h3>
        <p>Brewing it cold doesn't just change the speed at which the compounds are extracted. It also affects which compounds are actually extracted. Cold brewed coffee can have 66% less acidity and bitterness compared to hot brewed. Some bitter acids don't get extracted and some other acids don't get oxidized to give the acidic/tangy flavor found in hot coffee.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Coursely grind the coffee beans.</li>
            <li>Combine the grounds with water and let it steep overnight (~12 hours).</li>
            <li>Strain out the grounds and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
